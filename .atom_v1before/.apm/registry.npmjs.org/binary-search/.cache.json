is a really tiny, stupid, simple binary search library for Node.JS. We\nwrote it because existing solutions were bloated and incorrect.\n\nThis version is a straight port of the Java version mentioned by Joshua Bloch\nin his article, [Nearly All Binary Searches and Merge Sorts are Broken](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).\n\nThanks to [Conrad Irwin](https://github.com/ConradIrwin) and [Michael\nMarino](https://github.com/mgmarino) for, ironically, pointing out bugs.\n\nExample\n-------\n\n    var bs = require(\"binary-search\");\n    bs([1, 2, 3, 4], 3, function(a, b) { return a - b; }); // => 2\n    bs([1, 2, 4, 5], 3, function(a, b) { return a - b; }); // => -3\n\nBe advised that passing in a comparator function is *required*. Since you're\nprobably using one for your sort function anyway, this isn't a big deal.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis software is released into the public domain.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"darkskyapp","email":"devsupport@darkskyapp.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-04-14T13:41:15.935Z","created":"2013-05-21T14:35:54.820Z","1.0.0":"2013-05-21T14:35:56.693Z","1.0.1":"2013-05-21T14:37:30.617Z","1.0.2":"2013-08-29T12:15:45.608Z","1.1.0":"2013-10-10T16:27:12.333Z","1.1.1":"2013-10-16T14:30:06.335Z","1.1.2":"2014-04-09T19:35:59.504Z","1.2.0":"2014-04-14T13:41:15.935Z"},"author":{"name":"The Dark Sky Company, LLC","email":"support@darkskyapp.com"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/darkskyapp/binary-search.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/darkskyapp/binary-search/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"koslun":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"7R6YUVQOTC4QUOTWYV3COGRM1\""}
