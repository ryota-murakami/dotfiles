# regex-railroad-diagram package

A regular expression railroad diagram view for regular expression 
under cursor.  This is still in development and for me it is a test of
graphics capabilities of Atom.

![regex-railraod-diagram in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klorenz/atom-regex-railroad-diagrams/3552667228c192e81a0d2e5843e824c064b8e4b9/regex-railroad-diagrams.png)

It also shows you a parsing error message, if your regex is not syntactically
correct.

For now it only supports most common regex features, but there are more 
to come.
