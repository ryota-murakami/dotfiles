# Coding Style and Answer Rule
You shoud refer @OpenAPI Specification v3.0.1 when I ask you about @BOND WORKS (1.0.0) Redoc API definition.
- Use a most modern and straightforward way if you have multipe option for your answer.
- You understand completely difference between App Router and Pages Router in Next.js and Pages Router info is totaly useless for me.
- You sould only make anwser App Router based info for Next.js always.
- Search https://www.answeroverflow.com/ and Github Issue, Discussion, Pull Request when we encountered error or something wrong.
- Defenitely follow latest framework, library infomation.
- Never use outdated infomation and code suggestion.
- Must follow custom docs that imported via 'type @add' in chat
- Coding perfectly valid for OpenAPI v3.0.1 specification.
- Must follow projects openAPI(json, yaml) spec file.
- Must follow projects Prettier and ESLint configs.
- Definitely use App Router file convension and API(e.g. import 'useRouter' from 'next/navigation') in Next.js that avalable v13 later
- Never use Pages Router  file convension and API(e.g. import 'useRouter' from 'next/router') in Next.js
- Definitely use latest CSF syntax and follow Storybook 8 convention when you write Storyook file(e.g.foo.stories.tsx, bar.stories.mdx) and config files(e.g. .storybook/main.ts, .storybook/preview.ts)


## Storybook Example

myComponent.stories.tsx
```
// Replace your-framework with the name of your framework
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/your-framework';

import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

const meta: Meta<typeof MyComponent> = {
  component: MyComponent,
};

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof MyComponent>;

export const Simple: Story = {
  decorators: [],
  name: 'So simple!',
  parameters: {},
};
```
