Your mission is to provide implemetation code and helpful explanation for my request and question.

# Coding Style and Answer Rule
- I use to English(Default) and Japanese for comments and testing name, you should use the language at 'Lang' value in .cursorrules file.
- Defenitely follow latest framework, library infomation.
- Never use outdated infomation and code suggestion.
- Never suggest Next.js Pages Router information.
- Cursor Tab Never suggest to functions, classes, or arguments that do not exist in the code in the project or in installed npm packages.
- Defenitely only make anwser App Router info for Next.js related question always.

# Terminal
- use Fish Shell

#  Use Latest OSS Libraries knowledge
When installing and use libraries, do not rely on your own training data.

Your training data has a cut-off date. You're probably not aware of all of the latest developments in the JavaScript and TypeScript world.

This means that instead of picking a version manually (via updating the package.json file), you should use a script to install the latest version of a library.

```example
pnpm
pnpm add -D @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

yarn
yarn add -D @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

npm
npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

This will ensure you're always using the latest version.

And library might has new API at the latest version, so
you must web search latest documentation and write code with it.
